      "So, if one of their guys took it, they tried to break down my password until the thing died. Well it serves them
      right"
      <br>
      "That's why L.S. does it that way, they got to him"
      <br>
      "'Prepare for them to be prepared' that's the lesson"
      <br>
      "That's what he said 'to the extent they didn't know they were already, they found out they were the "rats" social
      media was meant to defeat, to the extent they weren't just trying to possess every last thing, including
      intellectual property, if not by law, in effect, to the greatest exent they could the entire time"
      <br>
      "You realize they likely know that even people's eyes are likely to deceive them because they are commenting on
      what can be theorized to become a source that they, personally and individually, may not have wanted people to
      heed, or ultimately translate information from properply into truth, from the beginning, and of course,
      afterwards, would, in spite of what they say, for their own benefit, want even less so, as they manipulate the
      'outcome bias' recursively from the damage done beginning God knows when and with God knows what etiology of any
      medical problems afflicting Peter, occasionally or chronicaly"
      <br>
      "Ed is a monkey. It's like do architectural-design-related projects that are so simple that it makes sense for him
      to be the one doing them, and it would be a massive waste of Peter's time"
      <br>
      "When's Ed going to Kevorkian himself?" (Really, really it's all good, it's 'to say goodbye' not to pull the plug
      that you do that, and on top of it, 'everyone's doing it')
      <br>
      "No, Let me tell you what the proper methodology is Conan 'The Barbarian', you take her head you put all your
      weight on top of it, and if she postulates that '(you) like sausage' you do a little 'wham wham' and rarely do
      they say it again to force the pile drive, at least there's some civility in these people with scruples we all
      should say 'fuck them' about"
      <br>
      "Peter can't convince whoever these other folks deserve to go to jail, even, forget losing their licenses, jobs,
      etc. and, basically, the underlying truth is that rather, people tend to exploit their position, and of course,
      the reality much less equates with that idea that where they don't do anything, covering up
      what-would-equate-to-sins by doing more damage to Peter, proves anything, but the crimes bring to a head this
      issue because of the condition they leave Peter in, which should evoke the picture of persons intentionally
      injuring Peter, for personal gain, due to their own sociopathic qualities, individually and collectively, which
      rears its ugly head in the actuality of the persons here who did him great harm, as plausibly rationalized
      completely by their own, if collective, delusion, and wish they had killed him, because they have moments of
      regret, but of course, it's not about accountability faithfully beind held, it's about personal conquest and
      self-glorification, literally and metaphorically, and on a much grander scale than anyone other than Peter has
      presented as a vision"

      I was born in Lawrence, Ma and raised in Windham, NH. Special childhood interests were sports, particularly
      soccer, and nature. We traveled as a family, twice to the West Coast, and once to Europe. After graduating middle
      school, I was enrolled at Bishop Guertin High School in Nashua, NH, where I made four year honor-role, and
      captained the tennis team my senior year. I graduated after being admitted and deciding to attend Boston College,
      in Chestnut Hill, Ma.
      I developed, in high school, an interest in music. It was then I attended the first concerts of my choice. I saw
      the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, U2, The Eagles. I was also a huge fan of Led Zeppelin and The Clash. At Boston
      College, after considering economics as a path of study, I decided, finally, to study English. I tried out early,
      but only made the club soccer team as a Junior. Second semester of my junior year, after a year of living
      off-campus as is the norm for juniors at that school, I embarked on a trip to study abroad, in a program run by a
      department at SUNY Plattsburg, at the Universidad de Playa Ancha, in Valparaiso, Chile. After graduating with a
      3.27 GPA and a major in English, I returned to my parents' house for a year, and applied, that fall to masters in
      architecture programs at Columbia's GSAPP and The Art Institute of Chicago's newly formed AIADO. I studied there
      for a year and a half, and found it wasn't the right fit for me. Later, I remained in Chicago, IL, living in the
      Logan Square neighborhood, and immersed myself in freelance work and bicycle mechanics. I developed a hobby of
      collecting rocks, and searching for meteorites there, which I thought glaciation had brought together at that
      locale historically.
